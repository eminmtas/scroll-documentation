You can use your wallet's normal function to transfer tokens within the Scroll Sepolia Testnet -- no additional configurations are needed.

## Sending a token in MetaMask

1. Go to [ChainList](https://chainlist.org/?search=scroll&testnets=true), connect your MetaMask wallet and add **Scroll Sepolia Testnet** to your wallet.
2. Get some test tokens from [faucet](https://docs.scroll.io/en/user-guide/faucet/).
3. Open your wallet and switch to **Scroll Sepolia Testnet**.
4. Click the **Send** button in the middle and type the address you want to transfer to in the text box.
5. Select the token in the **Asset** box and type the amount of token that you want to transfer.
6. Click the **Next** button and then click the **Confirm** button to send out the transaction.
7. After sending, you can find the transaction in the **Activity** tab in your wallet.
8. Also, you can check your wallet in [Block Explorer](https://sepolia-blockscout.scroll.io/).
